# atoms/testing

Test an Atom locally against a real temporary SQLite database without a
network connection or Cloudflare account. `AtomHarness` exercises migrations,
lifecycle hooks, serialization, `app()`, jobs, broadcasts, WebSockets, and
timers using the same `atoms/core` contracts as the deployed runtime.

```sh
composer require --dev atoms/testing:^0.1
```

See the [Atoms documentation](https://docs.atomsphp.dev) for local testing
patterns and framework-specific fakes.
